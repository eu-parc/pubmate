"""Incremental mint/supersede publishing with drift detection.

Re-runnable publishing of defining nanopubs. For each term, compare its current
identity fingerprint (:mod:`pubmate.fingerprint`) against the one recorded in the
id-map and take one of three actions:

* **new** -- term absent from the id-map: mint a defining nanopub, record its
  thing/nanopub URIs and fingerprint.
* **unchanged** -- fingerprint matches the recorded one: skip (carry the id-map
  entry forward untouched).
* **drifted** -- fingerprint differs: *supersede*. Re-state the changed assertion
  against the term's **existing fixed thing URI** (so the term keeps its identity),
  with every inter-term reference resolved to its new thing URI via the id-map
  (:func:`pubmate.references.resolve_references`) -- the targets are all minted, so
  this preserves link resolution rather than reverting to old-id references. The
  nanopub ``npx:supersedes`` the recorded one; the id-map's ``np_uri``/
  ``fingerprint`` are repointed at the new version. The thing URI is unchanged --
  only the defining/superseding nanopub URI advances, chained by supersession.

A term is matched against the id-map by **either identifier**: the old id the map
is keyed by, or the minted thing URI it resolved to (:meth:`pubmate.idmap.IdMap.resolve`)
-- so re-submitting a term under its current identifier supersedes rather than
minting a duplicate. Whichever form was submitted, the id-map row stays keyed by
the original old id (one row per term, stable redirect table, linear supersedes
chain). References inside a re-submitted assertion may likewise use either form;
both resolve to the target's thing URI (:attr:`pubmate.idmap.IdMap.resolution_map`).

Note the mint path (new terms) still mints the assertion *as given*; reference
resolution is applied on the supersede path, where every referenced term is
guaranteed to be minted already.

Legacy id-map rows carry no fingerprint. Rather than mass-supersede on the first
fingerprinted run, such a term is treated as unchanged and its current fingerprint
is *backfilled* as the baseline (with a warning) -- adopting "what is published
now" as the reference. A genuine wrapper change made before fingerprints existed
must therefore be forced by hand; it cannot be inferred without a prior baseline.

I/O (reading assertions, writing trig/id-map) is left to the caller/CLI, mirroring
:func:`pubmate.migrate.migrate_terms`.
